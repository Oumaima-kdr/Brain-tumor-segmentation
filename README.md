# Brain-tumor
Brain tumor occurs because of anomalous development of cells. It is one of the major reasons of death in adults around the globe. Millions of deaths can be prevented through early detection of brain tumor. Earlier brain tumor detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may increase patient's survival rate. In MRI, tumor is shown more clearly that helps in the process of further treatment. This work aims to detect tumor at an early phase.

# Brain-tumor-segmentation
Brain tumor segmentation involves identifying and delineating the precise boundaries of the tumor within the brain images. It is a critical task in medical image analysis, particularly in the field of neuroimaging. The goal of brain tumor segmentation is to identify and delineate the tumor region within medical images, typically obtained through techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. Here's a more detailed explanation of brain tumor segmentation:

## 1. **Objective:**
   - The primary objective of brain tumor segmentation is to precisely outline the boundaries of the tumor within medical images. This detailed mapping is essential for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of the disease.

## 2. **Process:**
   - Brain tumor segmentation involves the use of advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. Various algorithms, including classical image processing methods and deep learning approaches, are employed to analyze the intensity, texture, and spatial information in the medical images.
   - Common segmentation techniques include thresholding, region-based methods, and more recently, deep learning-based methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net architectures.

## 3. **Challenges:**
   - Brain tumor segmentation faces challenges such as variability in tumor size, shape, and location. Tumors can have irregular shapes and may exhibit different characteristics in terms of intensity and texture. Additionally, variations in imaging quality and artifacts can further complicate the segmentation process.

## 4. **Applications:**
   - Accurate segmentation is crucial for treatment planning, surgical guidance, and monitoring the response to therapy. It enables clinicians to assess the tumor volume, track changes over time, and make informed decisions about the most appropriate treatment strategies.

## 5. **Deep Learning in Segmentation:**
   - Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great promise in automating the process of brain tumor segmentation. These models can learn complex patterns and representations from large datasets, improving the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation tasks.

In summary, brain tumor segmentation is a vital step in the analysis of medical images for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. It leverages advanced computational techniques to provide detailed information about the tumor's location and extent within the brain, aiding medical professionals in making informed decisions about patient care.
