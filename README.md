# Brain-tumor-segmentation
Brain tumor segmentation involves identifying and delineating the precise boundaries of the tumor within the brain images.

Brain tumor occurs because of anomalous development of cells. It is one of the major reasons of death in adults around the globe. Millions of deaths can be prevented through early detection of brain tumor. Earlier brain tumor detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may increase patient's survival rate. In MRI, tumor is shown more clearly that helps in the process of further treatment. This work aims to detect tumor at an early phase.
